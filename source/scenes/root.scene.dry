title: A new planet
new-page: true

The crash has left you stranded. Trapped under rubble, you make out the smallest crack of sunlight. 
An organic planet. Plants smaller than yourself just out from a canyon of rocks. 
In the sky, clouds full of moisture threaten your existence. 
Two moons float close together.
